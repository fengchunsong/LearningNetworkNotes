              -p pid... / [-D] [-E var=val]... [-u username] PROG [ARGS]
-c -- count time, calls, and errors for each syscall and report summary
-C -- like -c but also print regular output
-d -- enable debug output to stderr
-D -- run tracer process as a detached grandchild, not as parent
-f -- follow forks, -ff -- with output into separate files
-i -- print instruction pointer at time of syscall
-q -- suppress messages about attaching, detaching, etc.
-r -- print relative timestamp, -t -- absolute timestamp, -tt -- with usecs
-T -- print time spent in each syscall
-v -- verbose mode: print unabbreviated argv, stat, termios, etc. args
-x -- print non-ascii strings in hex, -xx -- print all strings in hex
-y -- print paths associated with file descriptor arguments
-h -- print help message, -V -- print version
-a column -- alignment COLUMN for printing syscall results (default 40)
-b execve -- detach on this syscall
-e expr -- a qualifying expression: option=[!]all or option=[!]val1[,val2]...
   options: trace, abbrev, verbose, raw, signal, read, write
-I interruptible --
   1: no signals are blocked
   2: fatal signals are blocked while decoding syscall (default)
   3: fatal signals are always blocked (default if '-o FILE PROG')
   4: fatal signals and SIGTSTP (^Z) are always blocked
      (useful to make 'strace -o FILE PROG' not stop on ^Z)
-o file -- send trace output to FILE instead of stderr
-O overhead -- set overhead for tracing syscalls to OVERHEAD usecs
-p pid -- trace process with process id PID, may be repeated
-s strsize -- limit length of print strings to STRSIZE chars (default 32)
-S sortby -- sort syscall counts by: time, calls, name, nothing (default time)
-u username -- run command as username handling setuid and/or setgid
-E var=val -- put var=val in the environment for command
-E var -- remove var from the environment for command
-P path -- trace accesses to path

Synopsis
    qperf
    qperf SERVERNODE [OPTIONS] TESTS

Description
    qperf measures bandwidth and latency between two nodes.  It can work
    over TCP/IP as well as the RDMA transports.  On one of the nodes, qperf
    is typically run with no arguments designating it the server node.  One
    may then run qperf on a client node to obtain measurements such as
    bandwidth, latency and cpu utilization.

    In its most basic form, qperf is run on one node in server mode by
    invoking it with no arguments.  On the other node, it is run with two
    arguments: the name of the server node followed by the name of the
    test.  A list of tests can be found in the section, TESTS.  A variety
    of options may also be specified.

    One can get more detailed information on qperf by using the --help
    option.  Below are examples of using the --help option:
